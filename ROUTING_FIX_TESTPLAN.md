## Phase 5: Functional Calculator Testing

### Test 5.1: Calculator Form Validation
**Expected**: Each calculator processes inputs correctly

2. Expected: Error messages appear
3. Enter valid inputs
4. Expected: Results calculate correctly
5. Test export functions (PDF, CSV)
6. Expected: Export works without errors

- Updated timestamps (2024-09-23)

### Test 7.2: Robots.txt Check
**Test Method**: Visit [/robots.txt](https://costflowai.com/robots.txt)

**Expected Content**:
- All calculator routes explicitly allowed
- All blog routes explicitly allowed
- Build artifacts blocked (_next/, out/)

## üö® Failure Response Plan

### If Any Critical Test Fails:
1. **STOP DEPLOYMENT** immediately
2. Identify root cause
3. Apply fix
4. Re-run full test suite
5. Only proceed when ALL critical tests pass

### Common Issues & Solutions:
- **Calculator loads generic page**: Check netlify.toml redirects, verify build output structure
- **PWA icons 404**: Verify icons exist in public/ and are included in build
- **Console errors**: Check for JavaScript errors, missing imports
- **Mobile layout broken**: Review CSS media queries, test on actual devices
