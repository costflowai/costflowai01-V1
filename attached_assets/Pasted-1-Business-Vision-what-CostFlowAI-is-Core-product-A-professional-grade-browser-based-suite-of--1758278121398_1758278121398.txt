1️⃣ Business Vision (what CostFlowAI is)

Core product
A professional-grade, browser-based suite of construction cost-estimation calculators.
Features:

Transparent math (“Show how it’s calculated”)

Regional pricing factors

Professional exports (PDF/Excel/CSV/Print)

State saving for repeat use

Blog & search to attract organic traffic

Target users

GC/CM estimators, project managers, subcontractors

Small contractors and homeowners who need quick ROM pricing

Revenue model

Free access to core calculators to drive traffic

Paid “Pro” tier: additional calculators, custom exports (branding, multi-scenario), saved projects, API access

Affiliate or advertising from suppliers/training programs (optional)

Sponsored calculators/blog posts from vendors

2️⃣ Where you stand now (MVP status)

✅ Platform scaffolded: secure, modular, CSP-compliant codebase

✅ Calculator engine: concrete, framing, drywall, paint, insulation, earthwork, masonry, site concrete implemented

✅ Per-calculator pages: each tool has its own URL, loads properly

✅ Blog system: Markdown → static pages + RSS + sitemap

✅ Search index: generated at build time

✅ Netlify deploy pipeline: automatic builds with nonce injection

✅ Tests: Playwright smoke tests for calculators & navigation

Right now you have a functioning MVP with real calculators and a blog framework, but the public-facing polish and monetization hooks are not yet added.

3️⃣ What’s missing before launch

UI polish: styled homepage hero, navigation, blog listing, search box on all pages

Professional exports: styled headers/footers, disclaimers in PDF/Print

Initial content: populate blog with 10–15 SEO-friendly posts to drive inbound traffic

Analytics: GA4/Plausible to see usage

Monetization hooks: Stripe test mode for Pro features (saved projects, branded reports)

Beta feedback loop: lightweight feedback form or Google Sheets integration to capture user suggestions

5️⃣ Your immediate next steps

Merge and deploy the Blog UI + Search + Export Styling + Homepage Content PR.

Add real content to /content/posts/.

Run Lighthouse on production, fix anything <90.

Set up GA4 or Plausible in Netlify environment variables.

Draft your first “Pro” feature list for Stripe (what’s free vs paid).

Once that’s in place, you can soft-launch as a free tool, begin collecting traffic and feedback, and then layer on the paid features.
